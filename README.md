# Feature Selection using Swarm Intelligence Techniques

This project applies **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** and **Dispersive Flies Optimization (DFO)** techniques for feature selection. The goal is to identify the optimal subset of features from a large dataset to improve classification accuracy in machine learning tasks.

---

## Project Overview
- Implemented **PSO** and **DFO** algorithms to select relevant features.  
- Reduced dimensionality of datasets while enhancing model performance.  
- Evaluated selected features on classification tasks to demonstrate accuracy improvements.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn (for classification models)  
- Custom implementations of PSO and DFO
